Abstract = {Part of a special issue on data mining and knowledge discovery with evolutionary algorithms. A new approach for establishing classification rules by using gene expression programming, a new technique of genetic programming with linear representation, is presented. Several different combinations of attributes may be involved in the antecedent of discovered rules. The search process is guided by a fitness function that considers both the rule consistency gain and completeness. A multiclass classification problem is derived as multiple 2-class problems through the use of the one-against-all learning method.},
