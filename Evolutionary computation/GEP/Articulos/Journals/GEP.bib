  abstract = {Gene expression programming, a genotype/phenotype genetic algorithm (linearand ramified), is presented here for the first time as a new technique for thecreation of computer programs. Gene expression programming uses characterlinear chromosomes composed of genes structurally organized in a head and atail. The chromosomes function as a genome and are subjected to modification bymeans of mutation, transposition, root transposition, gene transposition, generecombination, and one- and two-point recombination. The chromosomes encodeexpression trees which are the object of selection. The creation of theseseparate entities (genome and expression tree) with distinct functions allowsthe algorithm to perform with high efficiency that greatly surpasses existingadaptive techniques. The suite of problems chosen to illustrate the power andversatility of gene expression programming includes symbolic regression,sequence induction with and without constant creation, block stacking, cellularautomata rules for the density-classification problem, and two problems ofboolean concept learning: the 11-multiplexer and the GP rule problem.},
