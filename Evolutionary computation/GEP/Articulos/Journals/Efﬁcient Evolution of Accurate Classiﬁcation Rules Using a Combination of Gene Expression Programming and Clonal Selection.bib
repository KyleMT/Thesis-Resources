Abstract = {The authors describe a hybrid evolutionary method based on a combination of clonal selection and gene expression programming (GEP) for data mining tasks. The method utilizes the concept of a data class antigen, which is employed to represent a data class. The hybrid method was tested on a set of benchmark problems, and the results were very satisfactory, showing that the hybrid method outperformed traditional GEP in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.},
