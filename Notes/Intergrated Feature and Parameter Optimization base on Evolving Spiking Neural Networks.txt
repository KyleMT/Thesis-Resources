Versitile Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (vQEA) combined with an evolving spiking neural network (eSNN).

#TODO: Lookup Multi-model Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDAs)

Following a wrapper approach. The vQEA was able to perform relevant feature subsetsr and simultaniously evolve an optimal eSNN parameter setting. The extended architecture will be referred to as QiSNN.

The encoding method seems to be vital to the accuracy of all SNN approaches. Several encoding mechanisms have been proposed, such as: frequency mapping, Poison processes, and rank order encoding.

Because the independent probability vectors interact on some level, a multi-modal EDA can be formed. The use of this EDA is the main characteristic of vQEA.

The selection funciton was identified to be a crucial factor in the performance of parameter optimization. In the early phase of optimization, the parameter configurations are selected randomly. As a result, it iis very likely that a setting is selected for which the classifier is unable to respond to any input presented, which corresponds to flat areas of the fitness graph.

Using the classification accuracy on testing samples seemed to work well.
